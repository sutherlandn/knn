        "1. What is the difference between regression and classification?\n",
        "**Regression is used to predict a continuous quanity given observed variables, while classificiation uses variables to make an assessment of where something falls, categorically.**\n",
        "2. What is a confusion table? What does it help us understand about a model's performance?\n",
        "**When testing a model's performance in classification, we can use a confusion table to cross-tabulate the predicted and actual values, which shows how many true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives the model is giving us based on the data we feed it.**\n",
        "3. What does the SSE quantify about a particular model?\n",
        "**For a linear regression model, the Sum of Squared Error can tell us how well the model fits the data, or how well it's performing based on data we have fed it.**\n",
        "4. What are overfitting and underfitting?\n",
        "**Underfitting is when you feed the model too little data, and thus it is unable to recognize patterns and use them to make predictions with new data. Overfitting, on the other hand, is when you feed the model too much data, and thus it is too complex and unable to perform well when given new data.**\n",
        "5. Why does splitting the data into training and testing sets, and choosing $k$ by evaluating accuracy or SSE on the test set, improve model performance?\n",
        "**We want to know how well a model will perform when given new data. Therefore, by saving some data as a testing set, we can train it based off our training set, then ask it to perform on our test set, and evaluate its performance based on how well it predicts the test set's data.**\n",
        "6. With classification, we can report a class label as a prediction or a probability distribution over class labels. Please explain the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n",
        "**Using a single class label is very simple, both in terms of clarity of understanding and comuptational efficiency. However, it is limited in showing the confidence of the model and misinterpretation. A probability distribution, on the other hand, allows us to make more involved decisions using the model's uncertainty, although it may be harder to get a read/intuitive understanding of.**"

Which would you prefer to use in practice, if you had to predict `DEATH_EVENT`s? If you play with the selection of variables, how much does the SSE change for your fitted model on the test data? Are more variables always better? Explain your findings."
